        <h2>3D Printing Machine (Lulzbot Taz)</h2>
        <p>An old 3d printer has been sitting in Ms. Barkers room since the first time I stepped in here, but we could never get it to work (the filament extruder was clogged.) This year I worked around this issue, found a new extruder, and brought this old machine back to life. </p>

        <h2>GlowForge CO2 laser cutter</h2>
        <p>Another machine that we got this year was a new Glowforge laser cutter. This machine was set up, but I was the first student to get it worked on the internet, and have it actually cut stuff. I had a lot of fun using this machine, and I hope to use it a lot more for my school projects next year.</p>

        <h2>EMCO Compact CNC Lathe</h2>
        <p>One of the oldest machines in this room is probably going to have to be this small lathe. I couldn't get it fully working because I did not have a computer for it (Computer numerically controlled), but I was able to get it spinning, and learned how to make some manual cuts. </p>

        <h2>Spot Welder</h2>
        <p>A project that we could have done for this class was a tin box, but I didn't do this project. Students would have had to learn how to use the spot welder. I learned how to use the spot welder, but for a different reason. On the belt sander, the table had gotten worn down from the sandpaper and broke off. I learned how to use the spot welder, and I was able to fix this table. </p>
