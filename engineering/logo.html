        <h2>Logo Project</h2>
        <p>This project wasn't exactly what I wanted it to be, but I think that it was a good project for me.</p>
        <p>I think that I could have enjoyed this project if I had more time to think about the meaning of the logo, and what I wanted it to be.</p>
        <p>This project helped me think more about the meaning of my designs, and why they mattered. I think that I might come back to this project on my own time, because the result that came out in class is definitely not what I want.</p>
